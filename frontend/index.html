      El lenguaje es un virus
      El paraíso es exactamente como
      Donde estás en este momento
      Solo mucho mucho mejor
      Vi a este tipo en el tren
      Y parecía haber quedado atrapado
      En uno de esos trances abstractos
      Y él iba diciendo: "Ugh... Ugh... Ugh..."
      Y Fred dijo: "Creo que está sintiendo algún tipo de dolor. Creo que es un grito de dolor."
      Y yo dije: "¿Grito de dolor? Entonces el lenguaje es un virus."
      ¡Lenguaje! ¡Es un virus!
      ¡Lenguaje! ¡Es un virus!
      
      Bueno, estaba hablando con un amigo
      Y le estaba diciendo: te quería.
      Y te estaba buscando.
      Pero no podía encontrarte.
      No podía encontrarte.
      Y él dijo: ¡Oye! ¿Me estás hablando a mí?
      ¿O simplemente estás practicando
      Para una de esas actuaciones tuyas?
      ¿Eh?
      ¡Lenguaje! ¡Es un virus!
      ¡Lenguaje! ¡Es un virus!
      
      Él dijo: tuve que escribir esa carta a tu madre.
      Y tuve que decirle al juez que eras tú.
      Y tuve que vender el auto e ir a Florida.
      Porque esa es mi manera de decir (es un encanto)
      Que te amo.
      Y yo (es un trabajo)
      Tuve que llamarte al amanecer (¿Por qué?)
      Y enumerar las veces que me equivoqué.
      Porque esa es mi manera de decir
      Que lo siento. (Es un trabajo.)
      ¡Lenguaje! ¡Es un virus!
      ¡Lenguaje! ¡Es un virus!
      
      El paraíso
      Es exactamente como
      Donde estás en este momento
      Solo mucho mucho (es un naufragio)
      Mejor. (Es un trabajo.)
      ¿Sabes? No creo que exista tal cosa como la TV.
      Quiero decir, solo siguen mostrando
      Las mismas imágenes una y otra vez.
      Y cuando hablan, simplemente hacen sonidos
      Que más o menos coinciden
      Con sus labios.
      ¡Eso es lo que pienso!
      ¡Lenguaje! ¡Es un virus!
      ¡Lenguaje! ¡Es un virus!
      ¡Lenguaje! ¡Es un virus!
      
      Bueno, soñé que había una isla
      Que se levantaba del mar.
      Y todos en la isla
      Eran alguien de la TV.
      Y había una vista hermosa
      Pero nadie podía ver.
      Porque todos en la isla
      Estaban diciendo: ¡Mírame!
      ¡Mírame! ¡Mírame! ¡Mírame!
      Porque todos vivían en una isla
      Que se levantaba del mar.
      Y todos en la isla
      Eran alguien de la TV.
      Y había una vista hermosa
      Pero nadie podía ver.
      Porque todos en la isla
      Estaban diciendo: ¡Mírame!
      ¡Mírame! ¡Mírame! ¡Mírame!
      ¡Mírame! ¿Por qué?
      El paraíso es exactamente como
      Donde estás en este momento
      Solo mucho mucho mejor.

        Paradise Is exactly like Where you are right now Only much much Better. I saw this guy on the train And he seemed to gave gotten stuck In one of those abstract trances. And he was going: "Ugh...Ugh...Ugh..." And Fred said: "I think he's in some kind of pain. I think it's a pain cry." And I said: "Pain cry? Then language is a virus." Language! It's a virus! Language! It's a virus! Well I was talking to a friend And I was saying: I wanted you. And I was looking for you. But I couldn't find you. I couldn't find you. And he said: Hey! Are you talking to me? Or are you just practicing For one of those performances of yours? Huh? Language! It's a virus! Language! It's a virus! He said: I had to write that letter to your mother. And I had to tell the judge that it was you. And I had to sell the car and go to Florida. Because that's just my way of saying (It's a charm.) That I love you. And I (It's a job.) Had to call you at the crack of dawn (Why?) And list the times that I've been wrong. Cause that's just my way of saying That I'm sorry. (It's a job.) Language! It's a virus! Language! It's a virus! Paradise Is exactly like Where you are right now Only much much (It's a shipwreck,) Better. (It's a job.) You know? I don't believe there's such a thing as TV. I mean - They just keep showing you The same pictures over and over. And when they talk they just make sounds That more or less synch up With their lips. That's what I think! Language! It's a virus! Language! It's a virus! Language! It's a virus! Well I dreamed there was an island That rose up from the sea. And everybody on the island Was somebody from TV. And there was a beautiful view But nobody could see. Cause everybody on the island Was saying: Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Because they all lived on an island That rose up from the sea. And everybody on the island Was somebody from TV. And there was a beautiful view But nobody could see. Cause everybody on the island Was saying: Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Why? Paradise is exactly like Where you are right now Only much much better.
